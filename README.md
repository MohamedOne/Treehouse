-------------------------------------

-   A Github Account
-   Android Studio installed

<span id="anchor"></span>Cloning the repository
-----------------------------------------------

With Android Studio, you don't need to use the terminal to contribute to an Android project on GitHub. It has native integration with git and GitHub to allow most actions via the Android Studio UI.

When you open Android Studio, it offers the option to open a project from version control. That's the option we'll use.

After selecting that option, you can type the URL of the repository, press "Clone", and select a folder. After that, Android Studio will do all the work and open the project ready to go.
